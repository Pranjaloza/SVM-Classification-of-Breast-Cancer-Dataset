# SVM-Classification-of-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
This project performs binary classification on the Breast Cancer dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with both linear and non-linear (RBF) kernels.


## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- âœ… Load and preprocess a real-world medical dataset.
- âœ… Train SVM classifiers using **linear** and **RBF** kernels.
- âœ… Visualize decision boundaries using **PCA (2D)**.
- âœ… Tune hyperparameters like **C** and **gamma** using **GridSearchCV**.
- âœ… Evaluate model performance using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.
- âœ… Apply **cross-validation** for robust validation.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (SVC, PCA, GridSearchCV, metrics)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: Breast Cancer Dataset (CSV format)
- Contains features like age, tumor size, shape, and other characteristics.
- Target column indicates if the tumor is **benign (0)** or **malignant (1)**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary

- Both linear and RBF SVMs performed well.
- Best accuracy achieved after **hyperparameter tuning**.
- **PCA-based decision boundary visualization** shows clear class separation in 2D.
- Model evaluation includes confusion matrix and classification report.
